### Practice Problem
- This used to be a very common problem in the hiring world

```
Idea: Compare two binary trees to see if they are equal in both shape and structure.

A Tree:
     (0x45) // hex 45
(5) <
     (3)

B Tree:
     (0x45) // hex 45
(5) <
     (3)

Q: Are A and B equal?

For the answer we must use the correct form of traversal.
That will be a Depth First Search algorithm because they preserve the shape of the traversal.
